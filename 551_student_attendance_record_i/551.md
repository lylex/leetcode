# Question:


You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False
```

# Analysis

这题审题是关键，要连续的L个数不超过2才行。

# Tips

# Code
```go
func checkRecord(s string) bool {
	var a, continousLCount int
	for _, v := range s {
		switch v {
		case 'A':
			a++
			continousLCount = 0
			if a > 1 {
				return false
			}
		case 'L':
			continousLCount++
			if continousLCount > 2 {
				return false
			}
		case 'P':
			continousLCount = 0
		}
	}
	return true

}
```
