# Question:

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note**:

You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

**Example1**:
```
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

**Example2**:
```
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

# Analysis

这题其实不难，主要就是把s的从小到大依次给g的从小到大的，如果符合结果加一。

# Tips

# Code
```go
func sort(g []int) {
        for i := 0; i < len(g); i++ {
                for j := i + 1; j < len(g); j++ {
                        if g[i] > g[j] {
                                g[i], g[j] = g[j], g[i]
                        }
                }
        }
}

func findContentChildren(g []int, s []int) int {
        sort(g)
        sort(s)

        var ret int
        for i, j := 0, 0; i < len(g) && j < len(s); {
                if g[i] <= s[j] {
                        ret++
                        i++
                        j++
                        continue
                }
                j++
        }

        return ret
}
```
