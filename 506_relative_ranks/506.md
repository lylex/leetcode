# Question:

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

**Example**:
```
Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
```

**Note**:
1. N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
1. All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

# Analysis

这题可能首先想到的是如何进行排序，然后找前三，或许还想到了堆排序吧？其实，这都想复杂了，简单粗暴的方法是，设置一个与输入长度相等的数组，然后，对应于输入数组，其对应位置的名次就是“整个数组中比它大的数的个数+1”.

# Tips

# Code
```go
func findRelativeRanks(nums []int) []string {
	ret := make([]string, len(nums))
	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		greaterCount := 0
		for j := 0; j < len(nums); j++ {
			if nums[j] > nums[i] {
				greaterCount++
			}
		}

		var out string
		switch greaterCount {
		case 0:
			out = "Gold Medal"
		case 1:
			out = "Silver Medal"
		case 2:
			out = "Bronze Medal"
		default:
			out = fmt.Sprintf("%d", greaterCount+1)
		}

		ret[i] = out
	}

	return ret
}
```
