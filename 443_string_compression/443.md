# Question:

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

**Follow up**:

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

**Example 1**:
```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

**Example 3**:
```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

**Note**:
* All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
* 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

# Analysis

这题思路挺容易的，坑爹的地方是，go无法缩减传入的slice的长度，只能是半成品了。

# Tips

# Code

```
func compress(chars []byte) int {
	var current byte
	var count int
	var index int // 指向chars中需要修改的位置
	for k, v := range chars {
		count++
		if v != current || k == len(chars)-1 {
			if current != 0 {
				chars[index] = current
				index++
				if count > 1 {
					if k == len(chars)-1 {
						count++
					}
					chars[index] = byte(count - 1 + 48)
					index++
				}
				current = v
				count = 1
				continue
			}
			current = v
		}
	}

	//	chars = chars[:index] // not work
	//	fmt.Println(string(chars))
	// copy(chars, chars[:index]) // not work
	//	chars = append([]byte{}, chars[:index]...)

	temp := make([]byte, 0)
	copy(temp, chars[:index])
	chars = make([]byte, 0, 0)
	chars = append(chars, temp...)

	return index
}
```
